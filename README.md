# Farmer-Consultant-System
 Farmer consultant system is a network base web platform that makes for agricultural purpose for the farmers benefits in Bangladesh. Different types of agricultural products are produced in 64 districts of Bangladesh. Almost all these crops have different types of diseases. Since the farmers of our country are uneducated and poor, they cannot accurately diagnose crop diseases. That is why I have created a web platform where farmers can easily diagnose their crops and take appropriate steps to cure them.
